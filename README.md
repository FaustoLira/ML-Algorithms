# Regression ML-Algorithms

In this project I use machine learning techniques to predict the average temperature for the next day in Seoul, South Korea.

The dataset is composed of several forecast variables for the next day, maximum and minimum temperatures of the current day, and auxiliary geographic variables collected for a period of 5 years by the Korean Meteorological Service in Seoul, South Korea. The output variable is the next day's average temperature (NextDayAvTemp).

The main result of this project is the use of different techniques in the data preparation and modeling stages.
